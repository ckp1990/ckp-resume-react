    "I am an Ecologist and Doctoral Researcher who bridges the gap between biological theory and advanced data science. My work focuses on deciphering complex ecological systems—specifically tropical forest ungulates and large mammals—by applying rigorous quantitative frameworks. I specialize in translating unstructured biological observations into robust insights using Hierarchical Bayesian Models, Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM), and population estimation frameworks.",
    "My technical expertise extends significantly beyond traditional research methods. I have architected SQL databases for large-scale monitoring projects and developed automated pipelines in R and Python that reduced data retrieval time by 90%. Furthermore, I have leveraged cloud-based computing clusters to decrease analysis runtime by 99% and applied Deep Learning algorithms (AlexNet, WSDDN) to automate the classification of wildlife imagery. This ability to optimize workflows allows me to handle massive, heterogeneous datasets with efficiency and precision.",
    "Driven by a commitment to reproducible research, I am deeply invested in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and conservation. I actively teach data documentation tools like R Markdown and have been recognized with the KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Award. I offer a unique blend of domain knowledge in population biology and the hard technical skills required to solve modern data challenges."
