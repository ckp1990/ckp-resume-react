# Institutional Logos

Place your institutional logo files in this folder.

## Required Files:
- `cws-logo.png` - Centre for Wildlife Studies
- `iisc-logo.png` - Indian Institute of Science
- `ncbs-logo.png` - National Centre for Biological Sciences
- `tifr-logo.png` - Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
- `wcs-logo.png` - Wildlife Conservation Society

## Logo Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG or SVG (PNG recommended)
- **Background**: Transparent background preferred
- **Size**: Recommend 400x400px or larger (will be scaled down)
- **Quality**: High resolution for clarity
- **File size**: Keep under 200KB each for faster loading

## Tips:
1. Use official logos from institution websites
2. Ensure logos are horizontally and vertically centered
3. Square aspect ratio works best
4. Test grayscale appearance (logos will be grayscale by default, color on hover)

## Fallback:
If a logo file is missing, the institution name will display as text placeholder.
