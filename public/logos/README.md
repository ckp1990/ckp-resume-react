# Institutional Logos

Place your institutional logo files in this folder.

## Required Files (in display order):
1. `cws-logo.png` - Centre for Wildlife Studies
2. `mahe-logo.png` - MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education)
3. `ncbs-logo.png` - National Centre for Biological Sciences
4. `wsa-logo.png` - Wildlife Science Asia LLP
5. `tnpn-logo.png` - The Nature People Network
6. `sjce-logo.png` - Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering
7. `iisc-logo.png` - Indian Institute of Science

## Logo Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG or SVG (PNG recommended)
- **Background**: Transparent background preferred
- **Size**: Recommend 400x400px or larger (will be scaled down)
- **Quality**: High resolution for clarity
- **File size**: Keep under 200KB each for faster loading

## Tips:
1. Use official logos from institution websites
2. Ensure logos are horizontally and vertically centered
3. Square aspect ratio works best
4. Test grayscale appearance (logos will be grayscale by default, color on hover)

## Fallback:
If a logo file is missing, the institution name will display as text placeholder.

## Updating from CMS:
You can update institution names, URLs, and logo paths directly from Decap CMS.
To add a new logo:
1. Upload the logo file to this folder (public/logos/)
2. Update the affiliations.json via CMS with the correct logo path
3. URLs can be left empty ("") for institutions without websites
